            <p>I shall never forget the former colleague who called me a "culturally deprived colored girl from the South" in the 1980s and dismissed my future as a journalist in front of my peers.  Obviously, he didn't realize that his negativity inspired me to move beyond that newspaper to become an award-winning reporter, editor and daily newspaper publisher for Gannett over the next quarter century. I thank God for Fannie Lou Hamer, Ethel Payne, Daisy Bates, Dorothy Gilliam, Nancy Maynard, Pam Johnson, Karen Dunlap and other black women who are journalism pioneers and legends who helped inspire and mentor me along the journey. A moment that reminds me of the work still to be done: Last week, ABC News ran a story on top female CEOs at publicly traded companies. Unfortunately, the average woman still makes only 79 cents for every $1 a male makes in the U.S. in 2010. Pay equity remains an issue.</p>

            <p>I arrived at The Washington Post in 1984 as a newly minted MBA with two years of experience at a small newspaper in a small city in North Carolina.  I was among the first women to ever hold a management position in the circulation department at the Post. I was barely 26. As a woman with a college-degree, I clearly needed hazing. "We need you to experience what our independent distributors experience:  Drive a truck!  Find carriers!  Deliver newspapers!  Collect the money!"  The night dispatch assistant, my first night, ensured that my truck had a flat tire on the delivery line. All the men watched:  Could I change a tire?  Would I?  It was so easy, even a girl could do it.</p>

            <p>When Garrison Keillor gave up Prairie Home Companion in 1987, I went in search of Lake Wobegon for USA Today. I drove through a number of small towns in Minnesota, bopping into bars and coffee shops, connecting with locals who knew for a fact they were the inspiration for his show, or who didn't know him at all. I was about seven months pregnant and I recall sitting in my rental car, saying farewell to a handful of townsfolk as I was headed out. One of them had been keeping his distance. Finally, he approached, leaned into the car, and said, "Ms. Chung. I have to just say, you do a great job. I'm a big fan." I paused, then said, "Thank you." Call me a wimp but I didn't have the heart to correct him. So I'm pretty sure there's a plaque at the local hotel that says, "Connie Chung stayed here." This memory has both a half full and half empty moral. Half full: Say what you will about Connie's journalistic skills, she broke all kinds of barriers, including into the backwoods towns of Minnesota, inspiring generations of young Asian journalists. On the half empty side: My daughter is 22. And, even today, to too many eyes, we still all look alike, and thus we're still often treated generically alike.</p>

            <p>In the late 1980s, when Kay Mills was researching her book "A Place in the News: From the Women's Pages to the Front Pages," she interviewed me. At the time, I was a copy editor on the National Desk of The New York Times. I remember her saying that few of the women she had interviewed up to then had offered concrete examples of HOW women's presence in newsrooms made a difference in what was or was not covered. I immediately thought of a recent free-lance assignment of mine that filled the bill. I had been asked by Dona Guimaraes, the grande dame of the Home section, if I wanted to do an update on the "displaced homemaker" issue â€“ women left without homes, jobs or workplace skills after divorce or widowhood. The subject had surfaced some years before and seemingly gone underground. Not only was I delighted to do it, but I also knew something about it and had a stack of books I had collected intending to write something on the topic someday. In doing the reporting, I found that members of the movement on behalf of displaced women credited a woman reporter, Judy Klemesrud of the Times, who died in 1985, with discovering and putting their predicament on the agenda. Almost everything reported on it was assigned and written by women. "It is the kind of issue that is almost untouched by male hands," I told Kate. I was proud that my example made it into Kay's book, published in 1988.</p>

            <p>In the spring of 2006, the Journalism &amp; Women Symposium Board of Directors met with a specific challenge: How could we afford all the good work we wanted to do for women in journalism? This ambitious national nonprofit organization aimed at empowering women in journalism had been a feisty force for good for more than 20 years, but now it needed some cash to take the group's impact to the next level. We had no budget for the kinds of things we felt were essential: expanded mentoring and digital media training for our members; travel money to help bring in great speakers to our annual conference; more money for scholarships to help diversify the membership with younger women of color. We put it to a vote: shall we apply for a Challenge Fund for Journalism grant that would require us to raise a $20,000 match? Gulp. Raising that amount of money seemed impossible to some. We weren't big fundraisers; we were more of a bake-sale funded organization. But we forged ahead and voted Yes. The end of the story? We won the $20,000 grant, and we raised almost double that amount to match it! In fact, over the next three years, JAWS raised more than $100,000 to match $70,000 in grants, allowing JAWS to get professional help to create a 5-year blueprint for the future, train more than 80 women journalists in a series of "I Can Do It!" multimedia workshops in Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Palo Alto, Calif. upgrade the JAWS website and offer financial help to JAWS members to attend the organization's annual conference, including dozens of young women of color. We learned our lesson: women in journalism CAN do it!</p>

            <p>When I became the first black woman reporter at The Washington Post in October, 1961, I purposely did not reveal my misadventures in the segregated nation's Capitol to my editors or white reporters.  I felt it would make it harder for another black female to be hired if I complained every time cabs whizzed past me near deadline, when a doorman on swanky Cathedral Avenue told me to go to the maid's entrance, when I couldn't be seated in a restaurant or shown an apartment in a predominantly white neighborhood.  My only resort was to suck in the insults and suffer silently.  Fast forward 20 years or so.  In the early 1980s, a young intern from Harvard named Michel McQueen came to work for the summer, joining a growing number of black journalists at the newspaper.  One day she came and complained to all who would listen that she had just been insulted.  It seems she'd gone to The Wall Street Journal's Washington office for an interview and someone there assumed she was applying for a job as a secretary.  Michel was irate.  I smiled inwardly as she spoke and thanked God for the civil rights and women's rights movements.  This young black woman -- now Michel Martin of National Public Radio -- felt free to complain!  Her freedom helped to liberate me and that moment crystallized what black women of my generation had to overcome.</p>

            <p>In my first week at Indiana University in 1969, I was required to meet with a guidance counselor. He asked, "And Jeanne, have you decided what you want to be? A teacher or a nurse?" I felt a swift punch to the gut. I replied: "Oh, I don't believe I want to be either. I have great respect for both professions, as I do for secretaries. My mom has been one since the 1940s, when she had no option. My grandfather refused to allow her to continue at Miami of Ohio after her freshman year in 1937, and forced her into secretarial school so she would learn a 'woman's profession.' She raised me to be an independent thinker and to make my own choices. I choose to study Germanic Languages and Journalism with the intention of becoming a foreign correspondent. Thank you for your time." I am deeply thankful that it is highly unlikely young women today must have similar conversations with a guidance counselor.</p>

            <p>As a young journalism educator, it was distressing to hear from a male supervisor that my choice of specialization "won't earn you tenure or have an effect on the news business."

            <p>To be honest, I do not really think much about the challenges women face in journalism. I think that shows how far women have come in this industry. When I first started in this field more than 20 years ago, it did seem to be dominated by men. My first newspapers were small and seemed to have a good ol' boy network. But it didn't take long to end up at newspapers where women played key roles. I am fortunate that the place I've worked the last 12 years has had such strong female leaders. Several women are in top management positions. We had a female executive editor who was promoted to corporate, and the last two publishers have been female. They serve as great role models.</p>

            <p>During the past 25 years, I've had the privilege of working both in the United States and abroad to promote freedom of the press, a fundamental human right recognized by the First Amendment and numerous international conventions.  One of my most challenging experiences was attending the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 as an accredited observer representing the World Press Freedom Committee. At that conference, then-First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered a speech where she declared, "Human rights are women's rights . . . and women's rights are human rights, once and for all." This past March, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's statement honoring International Women's Day echoed her Beijing speech:  "Human rights are women's rights, and women's rights are human rights." Secretary Clinton's remarks remind us that although great strides have been made, there is still much to be done to ensure international recognition of this simple proposition:  freedom of the press is a fundamental right that benefits everyone, including women.</p>

            <p>Right after I started my first full-time newsroom job, on the copy desk of the Providence Evening Bulletin, I was standing at the sink in the ladies room and a woman -- her job was to take dictation from reporters out in the field -- turned to me to ask a question. "Where did you come from?" she asked me. I was taken aback. She asked again, adding that the other ladies in the dictation pool were curious as to how someone like me had made it to the copy desk, which until then was a staff of men, all of them much older than I was as a recent college graduate. And there were fewer than a handful of other professional women in the newsroom at the time. I explained to her that I had studied (but not majored in) journalism in college and that I had been a Dow Jones Newspaper Fund intern in copy editing, and had attended the copy desk course at Temple University, that I had been editor of my high school and college newspapers. I reminded her that I had been a copy-editing intern the summer before in Providence, and at the end of the internship I was offered a full-time position to return the next year after graduation. I didn't realize it at that moment but now I know that at age 21, I was somewhat of a pioneer. Yet, then and later (perhaps even now) I haven't always known if the question refers to my gender or to my race as an African American. In the end, I guess it doesn't matter "where I came from," but that I have been here now for 40 years, and that I have worked to make it better for those who have come behind me.</p>

I am waiting for that moment when we can shift conversations about brown and black boys and men so that we talk about their contributions and not about their potential to be predators, that moment when we finally see routine coverage of Native Americans that has nothing to do with alcohol and casino gambling and everything to do with politics and when we see Asian Americans as mothers and not math whizzes.</p>

            <p>I lived through transition times -- never the first or the only, but still a rarity -- as a female television news photographer. Two stories illustrate this middle-earth existence: A guard kept me out of the Twins locker room, saying my press pass wasn't the right one to get me in. Moments later, a male colleague -- with an even lower level pass -- was let right in. No surprise, right? Except that when I went back to the station, the sports anchor had a fit, ran it up the Twins executive ladder, where I got an apology and the assurance it would never happen again (it never did). Another time, a manager pulled me off an assignment, saying he didn't think I could handle it physically. One of my fellow photographers overheard, and laughed and laughed. And shared it with all the other guys, who all thought it was equally funny and ridiculous. One myopic male boss, and 15 fabulous male colleagues. One more: One of my favorite moments was on a campaign trail when Elizabeth Dole stopped working the crowd to come over, say hello and how pleased she was to see a woman among the male photographers.</p>

            <p>I think the most important time in my career as a leader in The Inquirer newsroom for women was when I led a women's caucus that came together during the mid-'80s to challenge the pay scale, promotion opportunities and assignments that women were getting compared to the men. We found that women in the same jobs were being paid significantly less than the men. For instance, I found that the man I followed in the role as deputy metro editor who was in charge of vetting applications and putting forth potential hires was earning about $6,000 more than I was. And this was after I had created a major recruiting database to replace a system that was dysfunctional at best. I also led the newsroom in looking for more diverse hires. We gathered -- at that point we were about 90 women strong -- and called a meeting with the top editors. At the time, Gene Roberts was the editor and I think he really did not quite get the depth of anger among the women in the newsroom until he came to our caucus meeting. To his credit, he created a committee to meet with him to hash out our demands. We told him that it did not matter if he thought a woman with a child had too many outside the newsroom responsibilities to go overseas. If she was qualified, it was up to her to make the decision if she should go or not; not his. To that point, only single women were assigned to foreign postings. We also said that it was time for a women city editor to be appointed. Within months, Fran Dauth was named the city editor and Jane Eisner, who had a six-month-old, was sent to the London Bureau. And many of us, including me, got promotions and salary adjustments.  When I look back on that, I am so proud that we banded together, stood up for equality and won. From that point on, the newsroom was a different place and so much the better for it. </p>

Each had five people. There was one woman on each panel and, worst of all, we were ALL white until the final panel, which had a very pale man with dreads who may self-identify as black; I'm not sure. Fortunately, in the world of Twitter, you can contemporaneously tweet such abominations.

            <p>The defining moment that set my career course came the day I was hired as a part-time sports correspondent at The Tampa Tribune. I was fresh out of graduate school with a thin portfolio of clips and the managing editor suggested I fatten my clip file to bolster my chances for a full-time news job. He dismissed me with the offhand suggestion I ask sport editor Tom McEwen if he had anything for me. So I marched down the hall to the all-male sports department and took a job as a sports correspondent. The lesson then and now for journalists, particularly for women, is to take the road less traveled by seeking out assignments others slough off, or by volunteering for lousy beats, even if it means covering junior high school football games for months. Don't limit yourself early on or reach too high too soon. I meet young women today, fresh out of school, asking for prime anchor jobs before they've had the opportunity to cover weekend general assignment. I didn't apply that day in 1974 to be a vice president of news; I applied for any job that involved reporting. The sports correspondent's job led to an even less desirable remote bureau job that led to the less-than-glamorous night police beat. You get the picture.</p>

            <p>I am extremely fortunate to work in a newsroom where the three highest-ranking editors are women -- and for a company whose CEO is a woman, too. I'm also lucky to have worked very early in my career for a woman editor, one who was tough and inspirational and a force to be reckoned with. She was in her 40s, having recently divorced a man she married young, when she got a job as a librarian at a middle Georgia newspaper. She looked around at the work being produced by the newsroom and knew she could do better. So she clawed her way into a reporter position, and eventually became news editor at several bigger papers. When I landed at one of those papers, she not only taught me how to go after the news with guts and resolve, but how to demand more from my editors and from myself. I owe her a tremendous amount, and I do my best to try to inspire others in the same way she inspired me.</p>

            <p>I started my journalism career as an intern at the St. Pete Times in 1994. I remember a senior staff member pulling me aside and saying, "Erin, people will tell you that as a woman you can have it all, but that's a myth. It is very difficult to have a successful journalism career and a family. At some point you may have to choose." It was the first time anyone had ever said anything like that to me, and it came as a shock. I'd been raised in the "you can do anything" generation. The work of female journalists before me has opened many doors, so much so that I've have had the same opportunities afforded to my male counterparts. However, the words of that colleague come to mind now as I try to balance being a mother and a journalist. This combination has never been easy (nothing about motherhood is), and I feel particular pressure to perform as one of the last remaining practicing journalists among my friends. I think my former colleague was partially right about the difficulty of the dual role of journalist and mother -- the balance for me changes each day.</p>

            <p>For a long time I didn't believe I owed anyone -- certainly not other women -- anything for my career. I resisted getting lumped in with a group -- the "angry women of the newsroom" -- and being judged for anyone's merits other than my own. But then I had my comeuppance, nearly 20 years into my career. I was up for a top newsroom spot, but was flatly told I wouldn't get the job simply because I was a woman. WTF?! Really?! In this age?! Like, isn't that so '70s? In the five years since my awakening, I've resolved to pay it forward and unapologetically support the journalism sisterhood. I try to reach out and make opportunities for those that will follow me. And I remind myself I owe so much to so many women.</p>

            <p>On Dec. 23, 1968, I was named Women's Editor of the Evening Independent. I'd just turned 25 the month before, and can probably be forgiven my naive optimism. I was thrilled, and silently vowed I'd be on the Times Publishing Co. Board of Directors by the time I was 40. Despite successes, I was never even close -- and faced up to it in 1985 when another job I believed I had earned was given to a man. I thought it ironic that right before I got the news, I was encouraged by a sign on the Executive Editor and President's wall: "Sometimes the best man for the job is a woman." Fast forward to 2008. I was named Acting Chief Information Officer on June 24 and less than three months later, on Sept. 10, there was no acting about it.</p>

            <p>He served flank steak from the cooktop grill in their gourmet kitchen. The steak needed to rest, he explained, as he prepared to carve.  I marveled.  My boss's husband, Richard Karl was the head of surgery at a renowned cancer center, author of a book and, I think he would agree, a journalism junkie.  Cathy Karl, CFO of the Times Publishing Co., was the smartest, classiest, most confident and competent woman in business I had ever known.  And my then-husband and I were among a handful of dinner guests in their home. I felt proud.  Privileged.  This evening provided a rare glimpse into the world to which I aspired -- influence and affluence -- and a life I admired -- a woman with a rewarding career doing meaningful work.  (Having a husband to do the cooking was a bonus!) Cathy was the first female boss who impressed me as a boss and a woman. At work, she made expectations clear. She crafted complex decisions from carefully assembled facts.  She was fair, firm and earned the respect of everyone I knew. And here she made us feel so welcome in her lovely home with her successful spouse.  She could run a meeting and a party. She could do it all. Richard and Cathy served that flank steak about 15 years ago. I lost touch with her a few years later when I took a new position at the Times and she moved on.  But she showed me that night what I could become. Women can win in business and in life.  I work to model that for my two boys. They know I'm passionate about what I do at Poynter, and they see me live a full, active, balanced life. And when we gather for dinner, which we make a point to do, I know they love my flank steak.</p>
